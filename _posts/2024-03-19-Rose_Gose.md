# Catering Services for Your Event

Wine | Music | Freedom



Rose Gose is a cultural restaurant project originating from Europe that has moved to introduce guests to a new culture, flavors, service and attention to each guest.

Our journey will be hard, as we speak different languages and grew up on different sides of the Ocean, and we have only seen New York and Texas from movies.

But we are here, we are ambitious, we want to work honestly and give you impressions that you will share with your family, friends and colleagues.
We have created a restaurant that immerses you in European culture. We have assembled a collection of more than 250 different wines and a unique cocktail list. The menu of Rose Gose restaurant represents modern European cuisine with some Asian influences. We love pairing our incredible food with the finest wine or amazing cocktails.

Our mission is not just to create a restaurant about food, but to create a cozy atmosphere and make every guest a little happier. Just trust us and we are sure to pleasantly surprise you.
